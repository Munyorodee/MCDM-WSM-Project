er2,Epworth,Somewhat involved,5,5,5,5,"Population growth, Poor infrastructure, Governance issues","Establishment of a new water source, preferebly a dam which is adjacent to the Harare Metropolitan City area. The dam must be bigger enough to meet the current and future demand of water for the greater Harare Metropolitan area. 
The current borehole drilling projects are simply a short-term solution to a long-term problem, hence can not be sustained over time. The water table in Harare is also contaminated, thereby posing significant public health challenges in the near future. In addition, the water table is also rapidly deteriorating. With that being said, a long term solution is urgently required. "
